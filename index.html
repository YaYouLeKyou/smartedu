            <p>
                The project titled "SMART TRANSFORMATION IN EDUCATION WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" (Smart edu AI) will
                run for 24 months from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2026. Its main goal is to support personalized
                learning and development by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into education. The
                project focuses on developing student-centered AI applications, training teachers in AI tools, and
                ensuring equal educational opportunities. It also emphasizes individual learning analysis, data
                analytics, and sustainable environment skills.</p>
            <p>Aligned with Erasmus+ priorities, the project addresses digital transformation, environmental
                sustainability, climate action, and teacher support. Key themes include AI and data use, ecological
                skills, inclusion, equality, and non-discrimination.Target groups include students across primary,
                secondary, and high school levels, especially
                disadvantaged learners, students with special needs, language barriers, and gifted students.
                Teachers,
                educational institutions, administrators, and policymakers are also involved.</p>

            <p>
                Key activities involve AI-assisted training and workshops for teachers and students, carbon footprint
                reduction and sustainability workshops, AI applications in digital design and music practice,
                AI-supported teaching for disadvantaged students, augmented reality and simulation science experiments,
                and feedback sessions. Four main activities are led by partners in France, Spain, Turkey, and Poland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expected outcomes include enhanced student learning experiences and academic performance, improved
                digital literacy for teachers, a data repository, innovative teaching methods, and increased
                environmental awareness. AI integration will personalize education, improve efficiency, and reduce
                teachers' workload.
